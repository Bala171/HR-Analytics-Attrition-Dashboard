Attrition by Department:

A pie chart visualizes the distribution of attrition across major departments (R&D, Sales, HR), helping to pinpoint areas with high turnover rates.

A bar chart highlights which education fields experience the highest levels of attrition (Life Sciences, Medical, Marketing, Technical Degrees, etc.), offering insights into academic backgrounds linked to attrition.
Employee Breakdown by Age Group:

A stacked bar chart categorizes employees by age and gender (under 25, 25-34, 35-44, etc.), showing patterns of attrition across different demographics.
Job Role-Based Attrition:

A heat map matrix shows attrition rates by job role (e.g., Healthcare Representatives, Sales Executives, Research Scientists) across different performance levels, emphasizing roles with the most turnover.
